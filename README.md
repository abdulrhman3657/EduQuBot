# EduQuBot

Our project introduces EduBot, an AI chatbot for Saudi Arabian universities, with
a specific focus on Qassim University. By using a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, EduBot offers
a comprehensive solution for accessing and understanding complex university policies
and regulations. It aims to reduce the challenges faced by students, faculty, and staff
members when reading extensive legal documents by providing accurate information,
contextually relevant, and real-time responses to their questions. EduBotâ€™s capabilities
extend beyond simple question-answering; it acts as a virtual assistant, helping users
with academic procedures and offering personal support. EduBot aims to revolutionize
the academic support and enhance educational engagement. This project represents a
significant step forward in harnessing the power of LLM technologies to create a more
connected university community.
